        "# Python Basic Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1) What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use, making it popular for web development, data science, machine learning, and automation due to its simple syntax and extensive libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "  - In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions for the computer to understand and run.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name. All the keywords in Python are written in lowercase except True and False.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, you cannot use keywords as variable names in most programming languages because keywords are reserved words with specific meanings, and using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What is mutability in Python?   \n",
        "  -  In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after it's created; mutable objects can be modified in place, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?  \n",
        "   -  Suppose you write a method that depends on a particular sequence of objects remaining the same throughout the lifetime of the code. If you store these objects in a list, there is a chance that some other method using the list will accidentally alter it and thus break your method. Thus, in a way, a tuple offers a guarantee that a particular collection of objects will remain fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in   \n",
        "   python?\n",
        "   - In Python, == checks for value equality if two objects have the same content, while is checks for object identity if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) What are logical operators in Python?  \n",
        "   - In Python, logical operators, and, or, and not, are used to combine or reverse boolean expressions, resulting in a new boolean value (True or False).  \n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "9) What is type casting in Python?   \n",
        "  -  In Python, type casting (also known as type conversion) is the process of converting a variable's data type to another, either implicitly (automatically by Python) or explicitly (using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?  \n",
        "- In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. For example, if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a float variable, the programming language will automatically convert the integer to a float without you having to do anything.\n",
        "- Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion or type coercion, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another. Unlike implicit type casting, explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired data type conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and flexible program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  -  The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops?  \n",
        "  - The key difference between for and while loops lies in their iteration control: for loops are used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, while while loops repeat until a condition is met, making them suitable for situations where the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?   \n",
        "  - You should use a while loop when you need to execute code until a specific condition is met, making it perfect for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "  \n",
